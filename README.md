Script to check LDAP syncrepl replication state between two servers
===================================================================

This script check LDAP syncrepl replication state between two servers.
One server is consider as provider and the other as consumer.

This script can check replication state with two method :
 - by the fisrt, entryCSN of all entries of LDAP directory will be compare between two servers
 - by the second, all values of all atributes of all entries will be compare between two servers.

In all case, contextCSN of servers will be compare and entries not present in consumer or in provider will be notice. You can decide to disable contextCSN verification by using argument *--no-check-contextCSN*.

This script is also able to *"touch"* LDAP object on provider to force synchronisation of this object. This mechanism consist to add *'%%TOUCH%%'* value to an attribute of this object and remove it just after. The
touched attribute is specify by parameter *--touch*. Of course, couple of DN and password provided, must have write right on this attribute.

If your prefer, you can use *--replace-touch* parameter to replace value of touched attribute instead of adding the touched value. Use-ful in case of single-value attribute.

To use this script as an Icinga (or Nagios) plugin, use *-n* argument

Requirement
-----------

A single couple of DN and password able to connect to both server and without restriction to retrieve objects from servers.

Usage
-----
```
Usage: check_syncrepl_extended [options]

Options:
  --version             show program's version number and exit
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -p PROVIDER, --provider=PROVIDER
                        LDAP provider URI (example :
                        ldaps://ldapmaster.foo:636)
  -c CONSUMER, --consumer=CONSUMER
                        LDAP consumer URI (example :
                        ldaps://ldapslave.foo:636)
  -i SERVERID, --serverID=SERVERID
                        Compare contextCSN of a specific master. Useful in
                        MultiMaster setups where each master has a unique ID
                        and a contextCSN for each replicated master exists. A
                        valid serverID is a integer value from 0 to 4095
                        (limited to 3 hex digits, example: '12' compares the
                        contextCSN matching '#00C#')
  -T, --starttls        Start TLS on LDAP provider/consumers connections
  -D DN, --dn=DN        LDAP bind DN (example :
                        uid=nagios,ou=sysaccounts,o=example
  -P PWD, --pwd=PWD     LDAP bind password. Specify '-P -' to ask for a
                        prompt.
  -b BASEDN, --basedn=BASEDN
                        LDAP base DN (example : o=example)
  -f FILTER, --filter=FILTER
                        LDAP filter (default : (objectClass=*))
  -d, --debug           Debug mode
  -n, --nagios          Nagios check plugin mode
  -q, --quiet           Quiet mode
  --no-check-certificate
                        Don't check the server certificate (Default : False)
  --no-check-contextCSN
                        Don't check servers contextCSN (Default : False)
  -a, --attributes      Check attributes values (Default : check only
                        entryCSN)
  --exclude-attributes=EXCL_ATTRS
                        Don't check this attribut (only in attribute check
                        mode)
  --touch=TOUCH         Touch attribute giving in parameter to force resync a
                        this LDAP object from provider. A value '%%TOUCH%%'
                        will be add to this attribute and remove after. The
                        user use to connect to the LDAP directory must have
                        write permission on this attribute on each object.
  --replace-touch       In touch mode, replace value instead of adding.
